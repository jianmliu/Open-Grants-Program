## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

#### Tagline: A proof of capacity consensus module for Polkadot

The key objective of this grant is to use Substrate to build a production ready substrate chain which employs _Spartan_, a simpler proof-of-capacity consensus algorithm. This will provide a secure and extensible foundation on which the full Subspace protocol may be built using a series of follow-up grants. After careful analysis, we have determined that implementing the full plan for Subspace, as envisioned in the white paper, goes well-beyond the scope of an open grant. However, as any proof-of-replication is based on a proof-of-capacity, we can begin with the simpler task of implementing the more abstract notion of proof-of-capacity consensus. Based on our experience working with Substrate so far, implementing a novel consensus mechanism is non-trivial and requires a deep understanding of the internals of FRAME and Substrate. We would therefore like to take the time to do this right.

#### Relevance to Substrate & Polkadot

With respect to Substrate, existing consensus mechanisms include proof-of-authority (Aura), proof-of-stake (Babe), and proof-of-work (Kulupu). We would like to extend this with two more constructions: proof-of-capacity (Spartan) and proof-of-storage (Subspace), further demonstrating the flexibility of Substrate and FRAME for any abstract blockchain. Note that any proof-of-replication implies an underlying proof-of-capacity. We therefore intend to begin with the much simpler task of implementing Subspace as a pure proof-of-capacity consensus protocol (Spartan) before extending it into a full proof-of-storage protocol envisioned in our whitepaper. 

#### Team Motivation

Ultimately we want to make it as easy possible for developers to build applications where users can have full control over their data. We believe blockchain-based decentralized applications reflect the best hope for this future, but have been disappointed with the sustainability, scalability, and fairness of existing options. We are building Subspace in an effort to remedy this gap, while making decentralized storage central to the design.

### Project Details 

#### Intended Outcomes

Specifically, we intend to produce the following:

1. A set of abstract crates for Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) consensus: `sp_consensus_PoC` and `sc_consensus_PoC`.
2. A proof-of-capacity consensus pallet, `pallet_spartan`, which implements these primitives using `sp_consensus_spartan` and `sc_consensus_spartan`.
3. An implementation of substrate-node-template which employs `pallet_spartan` to construct a PoC blockchain client. 
4. A decoupled farmer, responsible for plotting and evaluating challenges, connected to the client via the RPC.
5. A live test network consisting of multiple nodes (farmer/client pairs) with variable sized plots and adaptive difficulty.
6. Extensions to polkadot-js which display the new relevant consensus information within the block explorer. 

These crates and pallets will begin as forks of `sp_consensus_babe`, `sc_consensus_babe`, and `pallet_babe`. Spartan and Babe share the same notion of timeslots and epochs as expressed in Ouroboros Praos. The key difference is that Spartan has no notion of authorities (it is permissionless) and we largely replace the VRF evaluation & verification with evaluation of the farmer’s plot and verification of the proof-of-capacity. Spartan and Subspace also have much in common, as they both use the same underlying SLOTH permutation, they have almost identical farmer implementations, and the consensus mechanisms are the same. The key difference is that Spartan is based on permuting a deterministic genesis piece with a nonce, while Subspace is based on permuting the actual blockchain history. This means that we can later extend Spartan into the full Subspace construction with minimal rework.   

#### User Interface

For this grant, the UI will consist of a CLI for the farmer and client and relevant extensions to the Polkadot-js GUI. We plan to construct a desktop application which wraps the farmer and client for the follow-up open grant. 

##### Farmer

This has a deliberately simple CLI with two commands: plot and farm. Plot allows the user to specify the plot size (in bytes), an optional storage path, and an optional seed for the private key. Plotting time depends on the hardware used but will take roughly 36 hours for a 1 TB plot using a standard quad-core machine. The plotter displays a progress bar showing percent complete and outputs some plotting statistics on completion. Once a plot has been created, the Farm command may be used to connect to a client with an optional Web Socket address. The farmer will display relevant log messages during operation.

##### Client

No new commands will be added to the client CLI, though we will add additional logging messages to reflect interaction with the farmer.

List messages

##### Browser

No new commands will be added to the browser-based polkadot-js GUI, though we will modify the display of relevant consensus information. 

List differences

#### Technology Stack

The farmer will be written in pure Rust. The CLI will be constructed using clap. Connection to the Substrate client will be mediated using jsonrpsee. The plot file itself will be written directly to disk using async-std. The binary search tree, used for evaluating the plot, will be built using RocksDB. All cryptographic primitives (signatures, hash functions, HMACs) will come from Substrate libraries. The SLOTH permutation is based on our own implementation of SLOTH using rug. The client will be based on the standard substrate-node-template. All consensus pallets will be based on pallet-babe and relevant slot based consensus crates. The browser GUI will extended from polkadot-js with all modification written in Typescript. 

#### Proof-of-Concept (prior work)

An initial implementation of Subspace was previously written in pure Rust, from scratch, without forking another chain. While we were able to get a rudimentary transactional blockchain working, which used proof-of-storage consensus, it quickly became clear that going from proof-of-concept to production ready (with all relevant tooling) was far beyond the capabilities of our team. We then learned about Substrate and began exploring the feasibility of porting over our work. This resulted in a smoke test of sorts, which showed that we could hack Babe into Spartan, connect to farmer, and hook into the block production pipeline. The purpose of this grant is to take the lessons learned from writing our own implementation and this quick and dirty hack of babe, to create a production ready set of pallets which leverage the Rust trait system and the idiomatic FRAME methodology of decoupled pallets, in order to build the foundation for a proof-of-capacity blockchain, which can leverage the full power of Substrate and provide a novel proof-of-capacity solution for the Polkadot ecosystem. 

#### Non-Goals

We must be very clear that we are not intending to implement the protocol as described in our technical whitepaper, nor will this initial grant provide the functionality needed for distributed storage which is our key value proposition. Instead, this is only a stepping stone towards those goals. This will only implement a simple transactional blockchain powered by proof-of-capacity consensus. While we do intend for this implementation to be secure against all known attacks, we do not plan to launch Spartan as an actual production parachain or independent blockchain. Instead, this will only result in an initial test network for evaluation purposes.

#### Other Materials (TODO)

* attach simple UI mockups
* define data model, interfaces, and external API
* link to lucid app flowchart 
* architecture document

### Ecosystem Fit 

Subspace provides a scalable distributed storage layer for Polkadot, by allowing parachains to have a native, low-cost, and permanent storage option. Within the polkadot ecosystem, we are targeting other parachains and dApp developers on smart contract capable parachains. We are also exploring similar use-cases outside of the Polkadot ecosystem. Subspace can ensure the longevity and availability of data which is too expensive (i.e. by tx costs) to store on the source chain, or would negatively impact the decentralization of the chain (i.e., by increasing blockchain bloat). 

Inside the Polkadot ecosystem, Crust Network is the only existing option for off-chain distributed storage. Crust resembles Filecoin in many ways, except that it uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in places of proofs-of-replication. This limits the storage capacity of the network to providers who have special purpose hardware, making far less decentralized and more expensive. Subspace allows anyone with free disk space and minimal computation to act as a storage provider and is able to scale many orders of magnitude large. Crust, like Filecoin, also provides temporary and mutable storage, whereas Subspace provides permanent and immutable storage, which is often more suitable for blockchain-based applications and smart contracts. 

Outside of the Polkadot ecosystem there are several storage-based networks, which we mostly covered in the introduction. At a high level Subspace provides both an alternative consensus mechanism (proofs-of-archival-storage) and a distributed storage network for arbitrary data. In the first case it builds on the work of blockchains such as Burst, Mass, Chia, and Spacemesh, while resolving the incentive challenges related to the farmer’s dilemma, and therefore being much more suitable for scalability. In the second case, it provides a generic platform for distributed storage, similar to Sia, Storj, Filecoin, and Arweave. Our construction is closest to Arweave, but far more incentive-compatible since consensus is based entirely on proofs-of-storage, whereas Arweave is mainly secured by proof-of-work.

## Future Plans

### Short-term

1. Apply to Substrate Builders program.
2. Close our seed funding round and continue to build out our business and engineering teams.
3. Start a supply-side community outreach program for farmers.
4. Start a demand-side developer outreach program for distributed storage.

## Long-term 

Subspace is a blockchain secured by free disk space. This space is used to store provably-unique replicas of the history of the blockchain itself. This is in contrast to blockchains like Burst, Mass, Chia, and Spacemesh, which employ consensus based on a useless proof-of-capacity of random data. Similar to Filecoin, we employ a useful proof-of-storage, or a proof-of-replication, but instead of storing off-chain user generated data, the data is the history of the blockchain itself, i.e., the block headers and transaction data, yielding a proof-of-history or a proof-of-archival-storage. 

User generated data may still be retained by embedding it within a transaction, providing a permanent and immutable form of distributed storage, in contrast to the temporary and mutable distributed storage provided by Filecoin. This is most similar to the archival storage provided by Arweave. However, we base consensus entirely on disk space while ensuring many unique replicas of the blockchain are stored, whereas Arweave bases consensus on proof-of-work while only ensuring a single copy of the blockchain is retained (in the case of a single large mining pool). Since we can also estimate the amount of space pledged to the network by the average quality of the proofs-of-storage, and we know the size of the blockchain itself, we can then dynamically adjust the transaction fees to reflect the cost of storage. Unlike other networks, this allows for an efficient market for permanent distributed storage based on supply and demand. 

Subspace has also been specifically designed to maintain the security, decentralization, and permissionless nature of Nakamoto consensus, as exemplified by blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It retains safety and liveness, given that a majority of the space pledged to network is controlled by rational farmers. It also designed to overcome a series of subtle mechanism design challenges unique to proof-of-capacity/storage blockchains which we refer to as the farmer's dilemma. This allows Subspace to apply a variety of layer one scaling proposals to achieve high transaction throughput and low confirmation latency, without sacrificing the security or decentralization of the network.

We intend to eventually launch Subspace as a parachain on Polkadot. This will allow any other parachain within the Polkadot network to utilize Subspace for permanent distributed storage. In the extreme form, each parachain block could be backed-up on the Subspace network, allowing for higher levels of decentralization and permanent data availability (even if the parachain later ceases to exist). In the average case, a parachain could employ Subspace to retain data which is too large to store internally, either through the native runtime logic or by individual smart contract. While the same functionality is theoretically possible with networks like Filecoin and Arweave, if Subspace is also a parachain, the cost of cross-chain communication would be much lower.  

1. Launch an test network for Spartan to start building out the farmer network.
2. Apply for an open grant to implement the key elements of the white paper, including: consensus based on proofs-of-archival storage, distributed storage, and decoupled execution. 
3. Launch an incentivized test network for storage farmers and executors.
4. Apply for an open grant to implement key scalability proposals outlined in the whitepaper.
